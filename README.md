# myapp-nginx

This is a sample nginx project. <br>

The workflow is:<br>

1. checkout code from github<br>

2. building a docker image<br>

3. login to dockerhub<br>

4. push the created image to dockerhub<br>

5. logout from dockerhub<br>

6. deployment to kubernetes. (I have minikube setup already in my laptop. Some other settings you have to complete in order to deploy to minikube)<br>

I have used the environment variable for the TAG. <br>
