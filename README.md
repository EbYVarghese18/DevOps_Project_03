# myapp-nginx

This is a sample DevOps project. <br>

The workflow is:<br>

1. checkout code from github<br>

2. build a docker image<br>

3. login to dockerhub<br>

4. docker tag and push the created image to dockerhub<br>

5. logout from dockerhub<br>

I have used the environment variable for the TAG as Date+Buildnumber. You can create as per your requirements. <br>
